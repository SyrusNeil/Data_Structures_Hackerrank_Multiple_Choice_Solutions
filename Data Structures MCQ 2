Explanation: Correct answer is Segment Tree. 

A segment tree, also known as a statistic tree, is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments. 
It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. 
It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. 
A similar data structure is the interval tree.
